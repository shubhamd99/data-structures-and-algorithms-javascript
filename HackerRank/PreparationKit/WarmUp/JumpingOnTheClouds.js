// Emma is playing a new mobile game that starts with consecutively numbered clouds.
// Some of the clouds are thunderheads and others are cumulus.
//She can jump on any cumulus cloud having a number that is equal to the number of the current cloud plus 1 or 2.
// She must avoid the thunderheads. Determine the minimum number of jumps it will take Emma to jump from her
// starting postion to the last cloud. It is always possible to win the game.

// For each game, Emma will get an array of clouds numbered 0 if they are safe or 1 if they must be avoided. 
//  For example, c = [0,1,0,0,0,1,0] indexed from 0...6. The number on each cloud is its index in the list 
// so she must avoid the clouds at indexes 1 and 5. She could follow the following two paths:
// 0 -> 2 -> 4 -> 6 -> or 0 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 6. The first path takes 3 jumps while the second takes 4.

// Complete the jumpingOnClouds function below.

    let numOfJumps = 0;
    let i = 0;

    while(i < c.length - 1) {

        if ((i + 2 < c.length) && (c[i+2] === 0)) {
            numOfJumps++;
            i += 2;
        // Single jump
        } else {
